## Headpiece
*Gyro Sensor BNO055*

To connect the assembled BNO055 breakout to an Arduino Uno, follow the wiring diagram below.

  Connect Vin to the power supply, 3-5V is fine. Use the same voltage that the microcontroller logic is based off of. For most Arduinos, that is 5V Connect GND to common power/data ground Connect the SCL pin to the I2C clock SCL pin on your Arduino. On an Feather 32u4 RFMx, this is also known as digital 3 Connect the SDA pin to the I2C data SDA pin on your Arduino. On an Feather 32u4 RFMx, this is also known as digital digital 2
